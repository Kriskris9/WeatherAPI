# WeatherAPI
## Description

This is a weather dashboard. If you would like to find out what the current weather for a city is, you can just type the city name into the search bar. Once you click the search button, the screen will populate with information on the current weather for the day and with information on what the weather will be like for the next five days. If you would like to go back to see a recently searched item, click on the button in the search history and it will take you back to the weather information to that city!
