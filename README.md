# WeatherAPI
## Description

This is a weather dashboard. If you would like to find out what the current weather for a city is, you can just type the city name into the search bar. Once you click the search button, the screen will populate with information on the current weather for the day and with information on what the weather will be like for the next five days. If you would like to go back to see a recently searched item, click on the button in the search history and it will take you back to the weather information to that city!
## Installation

## Usage

To use this work day scheduler, you can click on one of the time slots and enter any important event or meetings for that time. To save the event, you can click on the save icon button. During the work day, you can tell what time it is based on the color of the slot. Present time slot will be red, past time slot will be grey, and future time slot will be green. You can open and close the application and you will still be able to see the events within each time slot.
